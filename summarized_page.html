He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt.</p><h2>Early life</h2><p>Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, he reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father.</p><h2>Lineage and childhood</h2><p>In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Alexander's death marked the start of the Hellenistic period. He founded more than twenty cities, with the most prominent being Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists led to the overwhelming dominance of Greek culture.</p><h2>Heir of Philip II</h2><p>Alexander III was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon. He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedonia, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias. Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.</p><h2>Regency and ascent of Macedon</h2><p>Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide"</p><h2>Exile and return</h2><p>On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down.</p><h2>King of Macedon</h2><p>In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. He was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths.</p><h2>Accession</h2><p>When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of Stageira.</p><h2>Consolidation of power</h2><p>Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the "Companions"</p><h2>Balkan campaign</h2><p>During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court. Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine, possible future mistress of Alexander.</p><h2>Destruction of Thebes</h2><p>During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court. Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine, possible future mistress of Alexander.</p><h2>Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire</h2><p>At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip II had waged war against the Thracians to the north. Alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory.</p><h2>Asia Minor</h2><p>At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip II had waged war against the Thracians to the north. Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in souther.</p><h2>The Levant and Syria</h2><p>Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern Thrace. While Philip was occupied in Thrace, Alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece.</p><h2>Egypt</h2><p>Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC. They marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia.</p><h2>Assyria and Babylonia</h2><p>The Battle of Chaeronea was fought between Alexander and Philip of Theban. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's troops.</p><h2>Persia</h2><p>Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities. When they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance" which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as "Supreme Commander") of this league.</p><h2>Fall of the Persian Empire and the East</h2><p>When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleo would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian.</p><h2>Problems and plots</h2><p>Philip fell in love with Cleopatra and married her. Her uncle Attalus wanted the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece.</p><h2>Macedon in Alexander's absence</h2><p>In 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings, perhaps with Glaucias. He was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. It appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son</p><h2>Coinage</h2><p>The Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrh Familiesus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarius that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander.</p><h2>Indian campaign</h2><p>In summer 336 BC, while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated. As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.</p><h2>Forays into the Indian subcontinent</h2><p>Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed for having been involved in his father's assassination.</p><h2>Revolt of the Hellenic army</h2><p>News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled.</p><h2>Last years in Persia</h2><p>News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry.</p><h2>Death and succession</h2><p>Alexander stopped at Thermopylae before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth.</p><h2>Post-death events</h2><p>Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. At Mount Haemus, he attacked and defeated the Thracian forces.</p><h2>Division of the Macedonian Empire</h2><p>News then reached Alexander that the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.</p><h2>Last plans</h2><p>While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.</p><h2>Character</h2><p>After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), Philip II began the work of establishing himself as hēgemṓn. In 336 he sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia.</p><h2>Generalship</h2><p>Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods.</p><h2>Physical appearance</h2><p>Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain. At Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander "undid" the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future "king of Asia"</p><h2>Personal relationships</h2><p>In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius's significantly larger army, he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse.</p><h2>Battle record</h2><p>When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However, Alexander was met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill. After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Alexander was crowned in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. Egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by Alexander. Alexander restored the temples neglected by the Persians.</p><h2>Hellenistic kingdoms</h2><p>Alexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of Amun-Ra at the Siwa Oasis. Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him as Zeus.</p><h2>Founding of cities</h2><p>During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death. Alexander left Egypt in 331 BC and marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq)</p><h2>Funding of temples</h2><p>In 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia. He defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela. Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) while Alexander captured Babylon.</p><h2>Hellenization</h2><p>Babylonian astronomical diaries say that "the king of the world, Alexander" sent his scouts with a message to the people of Babylon before entering the city: "I shall not enter your houses". From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road.</p><h2>Hellenization in South and Central Asia</h2><p>From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes.</p><h2>Influence on Rome</h2><p>Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes.</p><h2>Letters</h2><p>Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessu had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius's successor.</p><h2>In legend</h2><p>Alexander chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessu fatally stabbed the Great King and then declared himself Darius's successor as Artaxerxes V.</p><h2>In ancient and modern culture</h2><p>Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria ( north and central Afghanistan) and Scythia.</p><h2>Historiography</h2><p>In 329 BC, Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes.</p><h2>See also</h2><p>During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court. The custom of proskynesis was either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. This was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes.</p><h2>References</h2><p>During the long rule of the Achaemenids, the elite positions in many segments of the empire were specifically reserved for Iranians and Persian noblemen. This created a problem for Alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and strength.</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda.</p><h2>Citations</h2><p>Alexander's official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot. He and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if he was actually involved.</p><h2>Sources</h2><p>Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis.</p><h2>Primary sources</h2><p>In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength. This ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War.</p><h2>Secondary sources</h2><p>Alexander minted gold staters, silver tetradrachms and drachims, and various fractional bronze coins. The types of these coins remained constant in his empire.</p><h2>Further reading</h2><p>Alexander minted gold staters, silver tetradrachms and drachims, and various fractional bronze coins. The gold series had the head of Athena on the obverse and a winged Nike (Victory) on the reverse.</p><h2>External links</h2><p>Alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests. Persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire.</p></body></html>
